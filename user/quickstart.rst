0. Try the Demo
---------------

Before installing we recommend taking a look at
:doc:`the Immunity Demo system <../tutorials/demo>`
to get a quick overview.

.. _install_server:

1. Install the Immunity server application
------------------------------------------

If you want to find out how to deploy Immunity for production usage,
follow the step by step `ansible-immunity2 tutorial
<https://github.com/edge-servers/ansible-immunity2#usage-tutorial>`_.

Alternatively, there's also
`docker-immunity <https://github.com/edge-servers/docker-immunity>`_
(in alpha stage) which
can be especially useful for testing purposes.

For testing purposes
`vagrant-immunity2 <https://github.com/edge-servers/vagrant-immunity2>`_
can be used as well.

2. Install immunity-config on your devices
------------------------------------------

Here's a guide on :doc:`how to install immunity-config on OpenWRT
and connect it to Immunity <./configure-device>`.

If you don't have a physical OpenWRT-compatible device at hand, you can
install OpenWRT in a VirtualBox VM, that's also covered by the guide.

3. Install immunity-monitoring on your devices
----------------------------------------------

If you want to take advantage of the features
offered by the monitoring module of Immunity,
read the :doc:`Monitoring Quickstart Guide <./monitoring>`.

4. Watch video demonstrations
-----------------------------
